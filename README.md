**Email Spam Detection**

Welcome to the Email Spam Detection project repository! This project focuses on developing an efficient email spam detection system by comparing the performance of three different machine learning algorithms: Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Multinomial Naive Bayes.

Overview
Email spam detection is a crucial task in today's digital age, aimed at filtering out unwanted or malicious emails to enhance user experience and security. This project presents a systematic approach to building and evaluating machine learning models for email spam detection.

Features
Model Comparison: Three classification algorithms are evaluated: Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Multinomial Naive Bayes.
Data Preprocessing: Includes text preprocessing techniques such as tokenization, stemming, and feature extraction.
Model Evaluation: Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are computed to assess the effectiveness of each model.
Visualization: Results are visualized through insightful plots and graphs for better understanding and comparison of model performances.
